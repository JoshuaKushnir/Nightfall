## Previous Session: NF-002
**Date:** February 12, 2026  
**Epic:** Backlog Planning - Complete Development Roadmap

## Last Integrated System (NF-002): BACKLOG.md (Development Roadmap)

### Active Global Types
- `PlayerData` - Complete player data structure with components
- `PlayerState` - Enumerated player state types (Idle, Attacking, Stunned, etc.)
- `HealthComponent` - Health tracking structure
- `ManaComponent` - Mana and regeneration tracking
- `PostureComponent` - Posture system for combat
- `Mantra` - Spell/ability definition structure

### Repository Structure Initialized
✅ **Environment Configuration**
- `.gitignore` created for Roblox/Rojo exclusions
- `default.project.json` configured with proper mappings:
  - `src/server` → ServerScriptService
  - `src/client` → StarterPlayerScripts
  - `src/shared` → ReplicatedStorage

✅ **Directory Scaffolding**
- Server: `src/server/services/`, `src/server/runtime/`
- Client: `src/client/controllers/`, `src/client/runtime/`
- Shared: `src/shared/modules/`, `src/shared/types/`, `src/shared/network/`
- Documentation: `docs/`

✅ **Core Modules Created**
- `src/shared/types/PlayerData.lua` - Strictly typed player data schema
- `src/shared/modules/StateService.lua` - Centralized state management (The Nexus)

✅ **Documentation Created**
- `docs/session-log.md` - Session tracking and technical memory
- `docs/BACKLOG.md` - Complete development roadmap (19 issues, 5 phases)
